{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Producer": "Muxagat", "Lieu Dit": null, "Desc": "Muxagat means \"owl and cat\" in Portuguese; it is also , probably more relevantly, the name of a small village in the Douro Superior wine region, located 2 km from the small town of Vila Nova de Foz Coa.Muxagat as a winery was first owned and operated by Mateus Nicolau de Almeida along with Eduardo Lopes. Mateus led with the intention to make local-varietal wines, expressed as “wines people would make for themselves”. Once part of a larger company that grew and sold grapes, Muxagat is now 80Ha of vines, where only the best parcels are used for the domaine wines. The land expands beyond with olive orchards and eucalyptus trees surrounding the vines in a full 300 ha of natural wildlife.Located at the high-elevation E/W border of Spain (450-500M ASL), the cascading ridges and slopes dwell where the exposure is raw, broken and unprotected by the cold winds and direct heat of the sun. Granites of various color-tones clashing with schist, feldspar and quartz underfoot, held together by a thin coating of arid topsoils. In accordance with this rugged landscape, with impressive diurnal swings, yields are naturally low. The plots, populated with only indigenous varietals, are interplanted, as is the tradition to ensure enough usable fruit when an off-weather season might limit full production. Tradition sets the stage here, but the story is beginning to express curiosity as to what the potential lies in the terroir. Matheus passed his ambitions to Eduardo’s daughter, Susanna Lopes, who, since 2014 is now the matriarch of the estate.Susanna looked first to the vines, with the guidance of Luis Seabra, who sources fruit for his own projects very near by. Viticulture is now focused on long-term sustainability, incorporating organic measures. The vines range in age between 10-40 yrs (some fo the whites being the elders here), but replanting seems to focus more on single varietal parcels (massale), which has created in effect, 2 presentations of the estate : Wines as traditional blends and as singular expressions of each unique varietal.The winery is housed not too far down the road, in a century-old concrete barn, atop a cellar lined with glittery granite blocks. In one section, under the clay tiling, lies a few impressive concrete vats. Nearby sits a few sizable granite lagares, with vessels of inox and old oak (even a concrete egg) wedged where they may fit. It is evident that the wines sleep here through the cold winters and are carefully nursed under the protection of thick rock as summer heats up. Susanna shares the cellar responsibilities with the oenologist Ana Sofia Silva. They are assisted in conversation with Luis Seabra as well. All is practiced with minimal intervention: Grapes are hand-harvested in small baskets, hand sorted. Wine is moved by gravity. only natural yeasts for fermentations. Some of the reds are foot-trodden in the old lagares, resulting in wines requiring a bit longer aging in barrel. That said, a current conversation seems to be questioning the traditional love for powerful extraction and densely tannic wines.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Producer": "Textura", "Lieu Dit": null, "Desc": "Textura is the Portuguese word for “texture”. The winery’s founder and owner, Marcelo Araujo wants his wines to be about their textures and feel and importantly how it makes us feel to drink them. Marcelo purposefully chose the Dão region because of its attractive combination of climate and geographic features offering optimal grape growing conditions. Nestled against Portugal’s tallest inland mountain region, the Serra da Estrela, the Dão is quickly becoming a magnet for some of Portugal’s best winemakers as the prime location for showcasing several of the country’s prominent varietals. Marcelo and his family made significant investments in understanding their land and building their winery (fit into the original location of a textile factory) to properly allow for organic farming and the vinification of their parcels separately. \n\nAlthough the overall winemaking is directed by Luis Seabra, Marcelo has teamed a group of amazing women in the cellar, each with their unique master degree in some aspect of the vine and wine production. Mariana Vala Salvador leads the team as assistant to Luis. Marcelo himself has finished courses in Oenology too. The approach is minimalist and ensuring the wines are not manipulated but reflect what the terroir intended. The team is young, inspired and visionary.\n\nThe cellar is housed in a reclaimed concrete industrial structure, now insulated and fully functional. It appears historic in it’s outdoor setting but opens to a pristine atelier that is entirely modern. Inside resides fermenting vessels, widely ranging in size, material and intention. The 2nd tier of aging barrels (of mixed sizes) has only just begun (This whole project kicked off in 2018!).

It has been in the Santiago family since 1899. For about 100 years, Quinta de Santiago's main activity was the production of wines, olive oil, lupine, cereals, milk, meat, and fruit for self-consumption. Grapes grown in the vineyards were sold to large cooperatives in the region. This changed in 2009 and from the passion and determination of then owner, Grandma Mariazinha Santiago (age 86), her children, and grandchildren, a boutique winery was born. \n\nAt the head of the family’s winery is Joana Santiago, a self-described “authentic Minho woman” - driven to honor her family’s heritage.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Producer": "Quinta do Javali", "Lieu Dit": "Quinta do Javali is a family-owned farm spanning 18 hectares (44 acres) along the left bank of the Douro River. The farm has a winemaking tradition dating back to the 17th century and has been in the Mendes family since 1982. The estate is dedicated to the cultivation of indigenous Duoro grape varietals, a foundation that has spurred 2 branches of the estates wine production.\n\nAs with all houses placed in the Duoro cliffs, the financial gain has been proven with hundreds of years of commercial success. Antoinio’s father purchased the vines as a traditional port estate, with little mind for dry table wines. Today, the estate still produces a number of wines, including a range of porto,  for a palate liked by an older generation, denser and more powerful, certainly with more alcohol, even without fortification. Why change something that is already working so well, right?\n\nIn recent years, António Mendes has tasted the future, so to speak. The family has made significant investments in several of the Quinta’s vineyards to convert them to fully organic and biodynamic farming (horse plowed and wild pig (Javali) tilled). His intention here is to signify that the Duoro too can produce incredible wines of terroir which are lighter, fresher and less weighted by higher alcohol. The new presentation reveals the flavors and elegance found naturally in the collaboration of Duoro grapes. His pursuit has led him to vinify sub-plots and varietals separately, even going beyond to use the excess raw materials (underripe grapes, left over skins, etc.) as a way to discover new wines while recovering/recycling waste. Even the few cement eggs (which resemble more an updated design of a soviet satellite)  have been made from powdered schist dug directly from the vineyards. \n\nIt is a remarkable ability of the estate to manage both the historical wines with traditional methods, while taking a “crazy” leap forward for the pronouncement of authenticity, terroir and excellence. \n\nIn response to an afternoon visit with Antonio and his winemaker partner Eduardo Rodrigues, we might agree that there are no two people more fired up for the future reception for terroir wines from the Duoro. Business for their traditional wines is already strong and the land they sit upon is a known treasure, but there is vision here, experimentation and a relentless search for possibilities. Overall, an exuberant, child’s enthusiasm feeds into an obvious knowledge of the place and process.  Final answers might be overshadowed by the joy of realization and discovery. Through their early endeavors, we may see the start of something magnificent for the Duoro, perhaps for the reputation of Portugal wine overall.", "Desc": null, "link": null, "img": null }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ [ -7.390096191719451, 41.186579492583078 ], [ -7.390858957268712, 41.185951332718979 ], [ -7.390500008774942, 41.184784750114225 ], [ -7.389512900417074, 41.184560407305625 ], [ -7.388660397744371, 41.184829618675948 ], [ -7.388705266306092, 41.185682121348655 ], [ -7.388705266306092, 41.186130806965863 ], [ -7.390096191719451, 41.186579492583078 ] ] ] ] } }
